Getting Started

Your application’s folder structure must follow the Model-View-Controller paradigm. You’ll need to use the express-handlebars package to implement Handlebars.js for your Views, use the MySQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect to a MySQL database for your Models, and create an Express.js API for your Controllers.

You’ll also need the dotenv package to use environment variables, the bcrypt package to hash passwords, and the express-session and connect-session-sequelize packages to add authentication.
